# chunkwm-rs [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/splintah/chunkwm-rs.svg?branch=master)][travis]

A Rust 'bridge' for creating [chunkwm] plugins.

## Features

- Event handler.
- Easy API.
- `CVar` support.
- Subscriptions.
- Border methods (feature `border`, see [Cargo features](#cargo-features)).
- Accessibility methods (feature `accessibility`, see [Cargo features](#cargo-features)).

## Usage

Add the following your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
chunkwm = { git = "https://github.com/splintah/chunkwm-rs" }
```

You then have to compile it as a `cdylib`, and use the `plugin.cpp` file from the [Rust plugin template](https://github.com/splintah/chunkwm-rs-template).

If you want to get the `Makefile` template and a small Rust library template, see the [Rust plugin template](https://github.com/splintah/chunkwm-rs-template).

## Documentation

You can view the documentation at [https://splintah.github.io/chunkwm-rs/master/chunkwm/][docs].
The documentation is automatically generated by Travis.

## Cargo features

There are two features that toggle the compilation of the C/C++ library: `border` and `accessibility`:

- The `border` features gives you access to the `chunkwm::common::border` path.
- The `accessibility` features gives you access to the `chunkwm::common::accessibility` path, and enables some extra methods on `Window` and `Application`.

To use these features:

```toml
[dependencies]
chunkwm = { git = "https://github.com/splintah/chunkwm-rs", features = ["border", "accessibility"] }
```

You can, of course, only use the features you're interested in.
